"farmersguide-title": "Farmer's Guide",
"farmersguide-text" :"<strong>-----Farmer's Guide-----</strong>
This guide is a much more in depth explanation of animal husbandry. Livestock animals need food in order to reproduce, produce eggs, lactate, grow and poop. Animals can be fed by dropping their preferred food on the ground or putting it in a <a href=\"handbooksearch://trough\">trough</a>.

<strong>-----Part 1: Basic Knowledge-----</strong>

<strong>-----Entity HUD Keyword Meanings-----</strong>
Saturation: x/y (z%)
This shows you the current saturation of the entity if it is a farmable one. X is the current saturation, y is the maximum saturation, and z is the percentage of the current saturation.
Hungry!
If an entity has this word in it means that it is hungry. Hungry animals will not mate, grow, mate, and cannot be milked. On average animals are hungry when their saturation is below 75% but this varies with the Resistance trait.
Wild
When a wild female reproduces, its offspring will not increase in generation. The player must feed her either by trough or dropping an item she can eat. Once she is no longer wild, all her offspring and their offspring will gain generations.
Infertile
Females have a limited number of times they can give birth, and when they reach the max they can no longer get pregnant. Infertile chickens will also no longer lay eggs or incubate eggs.
Can be sheared
When an entity can be sheared it will display this. Right clicking with shears will cause it to drop an item. There is a chance you will damage it in the process.

<strong>-----Traits-----</strong>
 All farmable animals have genetic traits that determine different stats for it, shift+ctrl+right click an entity with an empty hand, to see the stats in your info log. Stats are inherited from parents. They range from Poor, Below Average, Average, Above Average, Exceptional
Health: Increases or decreases maximum health. Levels: -1, -0.5, 0, +0.5, +1
Speed: Increases or decreases movement speed. Levels: -20%, -10%, 0, +10%, + 10%
Digestion: Determines saturation per portion of food. Levels: 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5
Hunger: Determines how much saturation is lost per day. Levels 1.5, 1.25, 1, 0.75, 0.5
Resistance: Determines how much food an animal needs not to be hungry and how resistant they are to miscarriages. (with Useful Stuff mod installed also determines how much damage they take)
Levels: +25%, +12.5%, 0, -12.5%, 25%

<strong>-----Reproduction-----</strong>
Animals cannot be hungry to mate. When mating occurs the female gets pregnant she will have an increased food consumption of +50% for the duration of her pregnancy. Pregnant females can have a miscarriage if either their saturation drops below 50% or their health drops below 25%. This is affected by the Resistance trait. Babies have only half the maximum saturation of their adult selves. Babies that are hungry will stop growing, so keep them fed throughout their childhood! Female animals have a limited number of times they can get pregnant/lay eggs, then they will become infertile and stop bearing children.

<strong>-----Feeding-----</strong>
Animals can eat and gain saturation by either grazing on vegetation, eating loose items, preying on other animals, or eating food from troughs. Animals will also be attracted to players when they have a food they like in their hands. Note: Animals will eat items and prey even if they are already full. All farmable animals can be fed animal feed either in a trough or as an item. It is relatively cheap and has a long shelf life but requires much more effort to make and attracts everything, including predatory wolves, and agile deers that can jump fences and steal food. Animals still need food even when unloaded, the only way for them to get food and not starve is for a trough with food is nearby.

<strong>-----Part 3: Other Knowledge-----</strong>

<strong>-----Grubs-----</strong>
<a href=\"handbook://item-insect-grub\">Grubs</a> can be collected by placing a compost bin full of rot on top of a hopper. Grubs will grow and eat the rot and fall into the hopper. They can be eaten for a tiny snack(GROSS!), and you can place them on the ground by shift+right clicking. They will go around and eat poop.

<strong>-----Animal Handling Gloves-----</strong>
These <a href=\"handbook://item-farmlife:handlinggloves\">thick leather gloves</a> can be used to pick up all farmable baby animals as well as grown up hares and chickens. Simple right click to pick them up and right click again to drop. Note: If you take any damage or switch to another item you will drop the animal.

<strong>-----Animal Trader-----</strong>
Animal traders specialize in the selling of domesticated animals. They will sell <a href=\"handbooksearch://caged\">caged babies</a> at generation 10, for a hefty fee of course.

<strong>-----Poop-----</strong>
<a href=\"handbooksearch://poop\">Poop</a> can be used to fertilize farmland or can turn medium fertility soil into high fertility soil.

<strong>-----Compost Bin-----</strong>
The <a href=\"handbook://block-farmlife:compostbin\">compost bin</a> can be used to rot perishable things or to farm maggots.

<strong>-----Other Tips & Knowledge-----</strong>
Hold shift while filling a trough to put in 4 at a time
Grain crops drop grass
If you have meat from another mod, it can be fed to meat eating wolves and pigs by making sure it is in an edible form, by either cooking or curing it.
While animals can graze on all plants, not all plants are good for them. While horsetail can heal, lily of the valley, fly agaric mushrooms, cinnamon ferns, and eagle ferns will poison animals.
If you want to raise dogs for other people, make sure you do not claim the wolves! Once you put a collar on a wolf it turns into a dog that only you control, and any babies made from female dogs owned by you will also be owned by you.
The traits will also show you the age of the baby, and the amount of births a female animal has left. If Useful Stuff mod is installed it will also display that entities given name with a ceramic tablet.
For big animals, like sheep, make sure you give them a wide area and put there trough in the middle of the pen. They will walk in circles if they cannot path properly.
